## Fast Typers on Keyboards Type Faster on Smartphones

### Abstract
- Investigated if university students who type fast on keyboards also type faster on smartphones.
- Explored predictors associated with smartphone typing speed.
- Used linear mixed models to analyze relationships between keyboard typing, phone typing, and other factors.

### Introduction
- Explored the correlation between keyboard typing skills and smartphone typing speed.
- Surveyed 39 University of Toronto students in STA490.
- Examined various factors influencing typing speeds including language fluency, gaming, physical limitations, and other activities involving finger movements.

### Data Summary
- Collected data through Microsoft Forms and 10FastFingers website.
- 39 participants, 3 trials for each student for keyboard and smartphone typing.
- Recorded factors like age, English fluency, gaming, keyboard instruments, physical limitations, phone type, keyboard usage, etc.

### Methods
- Utilized linear mixed models to analyze repeated measurements of typing speeds.
- Employed full models with both fixed and random effects.
- Used Wald tests for predictor selection and reduced model determination.

### Results
- Found significant positive relationships between keyboard typing speed, phone typing accuracy, iPhone usage, and smartphone typing speed.
- Identified a negative relationship between keyboard typing accuracy and phone typing speed.
- Highlighted the significant impact of phone type on smartphone typing speed.

### Discussion
- Acknowledged limitations due to sample size and limited participant diversity.
- Noted the need for clearer survey questions and additional variables for more comprehensive analyses.
- Suggested future studies include wider participant representation and detailed phone specifications.

### Appendix
- Showcased histograms and participant characteristics in tables and figures.
